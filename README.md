**Project Name:** Lifestyle Management

**Project Version:** 1.1

**Team Members:** Gagneet Sachdeva, Greeshma Parimi, Purva Patil

We are submitting the 'Checkpoint 3 - Basic Functionality' for Lifestyle Management, for focusing more on the main functionality of our app, we are not implementing the 'Routine' section of the landing page for now. 

**Happy Path:**
User Login → Click ‘Breaks’ on Dashboard → Click on any Break → Edit Break →
After selecting the time & date, alarm will be set → Alarm/Notification will alert the
user about the saved break at that particular time.
